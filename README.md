# Recommender Systems Project

Welcome to the Recommender Systems Project repository! This project is designed to educate students about the different types of recommender systems, including popularity recommenders, user-based recommenders, and item-based recommenders. By working with these systems, students will gain hands-on experience and practical knowledge that can be applied to real-world datasets.

## About the Project

The Recommender Systems Project was created for students to explore the intricacies of recommendation algorithms. Through this project, students will develop three distinct movie recommendation systems using the MovieLens dataset, similar to the recommendation rows seen on Netflix. Although the notebooks in this repository focus on book recommendation data, the skills learned here will be directly applicable to the MovieLens dataset.

## Key Features

### Hands-On Notebooks
- **Interactive Notebooks**: These guide students through the process of building various types of recommender systems. The notebooks are designed to be run locally, providing a practical and interactive learning experience.

### Types of Recommenders
- **Popularity Recommenders**: Learn how to implement a system that recommends the most popular items.
- **User-Based Recommenders**: Understand how to create recommendations based on user similarity.
- **Item-Based Recommenders**: Discover how to build a system that recommends items similar to what a user has liked.

### Learning Objectives
Gain a deep understanding of:
- The fundamental principles behind different recommendation algorithms.
- How to process and analyse data for building recommender systems.
- Practical implementation of algorithms using popular datasets.

## Learning Platform

While this repository contains interactive notebooks for hands-on practice, it is complemented by a comprehensive learning platform. This platform offers detailed resources and information on various topics such as the theory behind recommender systems, data processing techniques, and advanced algorithms. Note that the learning platform is not included in this repository but serves as an essential companion to the notebooks.

## Encouraging Innovation

Students are encouraged to take the knowledge and skills gained from this project and innovate. Apply what you've learned to create unique and effective recommendation systems tailored to different applications or datasets. The goal is not just to learn but to also innovate and create.

Happy coding, and enjoy your journey into the fascinating world of recommender systems!
